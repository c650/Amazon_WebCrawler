# Amazon_WebCrawer
# This repository contains crawlers built to scrape Amazon.com for information, such as reviews, ratings, etc. My programs were edited      # from ScrapeHeroâ€™s original amazon web crawler. I used their code as a basis to learn how to scrape using python. The source to their    # code can be found here:
