# Amazon WebCrawler
This repository contains crawlers built to scrape Amazon.com for information, such as reviews, ratings, etc. My programs were edited    from ScrapeHeroâ€™s original amazon web crawler. I used [their code](https://www.scrapehero.com/how-to-scrape-amazon-product-reviews/) as a basis to learn how to scrape using python.

Their code can also be found here: ScrapeHeroAmzonReviewScraper.
